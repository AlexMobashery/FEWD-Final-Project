			<h3>Meet Alex Mobashery:</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
			Hey there! my name is Alex and I'm a woodworker. Thanks for clicking on my website. Please make yourself at home, if only digitally.
			</p>
			<p>
			My passion for woodworking begain in freshman year of high school, when I decided to use my remaining elective to take a intro shop class.
			I enjoyed the fundamental class so much that I opted to take the second year class in the zero-hour block, meaning I would start everyday in the shop. Since then, I have amassed a collection of tools and have been making a variety of projects.
			</p>
			<p>
			Since finishing college I have devoted much of my freetime to building furniture. My style is influence by mid century designs, the work of Sam Maloof, and the maker community of YouTube.
